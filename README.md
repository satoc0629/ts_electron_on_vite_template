# ts_electron_on_vite_template
This project template is a fast Electron development environment.
The front end consists of TypeScript+React+Vite.
Electron is configured with TypeScript+Vite.
The hot reloading of both will be a feature of this project.

I got the idea for these project configurations from the following links
